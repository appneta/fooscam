    <p>Welcome to FoosCam!</p>
    This thing is still a work in progress but it's more or less working at the moment. Stats are being tracked and triggering on game start and game end events
    is pretty well functional. If you do, or do not want your stats tracked here's a couple things to keep in mind about how FoosCam watches games.</p>
    <ul><li>When no ID cards are on the table, no stats are tracked.</li>
    <li>When four ID cards are on the table (including Guest cards) tracking is activated.</li>
    <li>While tracking if all four cards cannot be <em>seen by the camera</em> the game is considered over.</li>
    <li>While tracking if the score for either side goes from 8 or more back to 0 the game is considered over.</li>
    <li>While tracking if player ID's move from one position to another the game is considered over. This means swapping places with your teammate ends the game.</li>
    <li>When one of these game over events occurs the team with the highest score on the board <em>before</em> the event is considered the winner.</li>
    <li>If you're tied 8-8 or 9-9 and a game over event occurs the game goes down as a tie, so take a moment to set the winner to 10 or the loser to 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other Stuff:</p>
    The code for FoosCam lives <a href="https://github.com/appneta/fooscam">here</a>. Wanna help? Awesome! If you haven't got a github account yet you'll need one soon enough anyway, get one and drop by #fooscam in hipchat and we'll add you to the project. Feel free to patch, submit pull requests (the front end is OOOGLY, css/js anybody?), bug reports, feature requests, harsh criticism, unpopular opinions about touchy subjects, proof of purchase, etc. etc. I'm not saying anything will get done, but what the hell? It's been pretty fun playin around with this thing. Why not tag in? The folks in the Boston office have open sourced a <a href="http://dev.appneta.com/open-source/">few cool projects</a> and have been throwin the gauntlet down in our direction to jump in the game. I think it'd be pretty fun to "launch" FoosView as an addition to our platform on the Appneta blog on April 1st. ;)
    <p>Some Things We've Talked About Throwing In:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Integration with the <a href="http://challonge.com/">Challonge</a> <a href="http://challonge.com/api">API</a></li>
    <li>A better <a href="/history">stats page</a> - top players, red vs blue, monthly / weekly, auto teams (you + your bestie ranked as "Team Awesomesauce")</li>
    <li>Integration into the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/live/getting-started">Youtube LiveStream API</a> (management won't <a href="http://foosview.appneta.com">hate that right?</a>)</li>
    <li>Support for multiple tables: Fifth Floor Foos! <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=boston+ma">Summer St Foos?</a></li>
    <li>At the table interface (Someone mentioned they had a few cheap android tablets lying around ...)</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Bidirectional HipChat support!?</li>
    <li><img src="https://dujrsrsgsd3nh.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/awyea.png" alt="(awyeah)" title="(awyeah)"></li>
    </ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> support</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/appneta/fooscam/blob/master/foosdb/static/index.html#L17">ditching jQuery polling in favour of WebSockets</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/appneta/fooscam/issues/new">Some other crazy stuff!</a></li>
    </ul>
